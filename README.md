# Power Four

This is a Power Four implementation in c++ with the ability to play Player vs Player, Ia vs Player or Ia vs Ia.

The point of making this game is to train myslef to make a MinMax Ia implementation based on a Power Four.

The quality of the code may be not perfect and I'm sorry about it, I'm currently learning C++.
